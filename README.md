# Vue complete guide

Repository to study Vue following `Vue JS - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)` course.

Meanwhile I started the course, it was update to Vue 3 with new classes. As I was in beginning, I just shifted to Vue 3 classes and updated sections 1-5 to 23-27 and begun again on section 5 (after the monster slayer game that I've completed on Vue 2).
